# Capstone Proposal 
### 20 Years of IGN Game Reviews
##### By Ellen Savoye

#### **The Problem**
*What is the problem I want to solve?*

Over the last 20 years, a plethora of video games have been released in an ever growing market of gaming consoles. Given the diversity, I would like to determine if, by year and over the years, there is a particular console that is the most popular by use and by average game rating. In addition, I would like to determine if, by year and over the years within reason, there is a particular video game genre that is heralded as the favorite by rating and amount of games within that genre with a positive rating.

#### **The Client**
*Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?*

The client of this analysis would be console and video game creators. With the results, the client would be able to determine their market/popularity standing in comparison to other consoles. Furthermore, the client would be able to determine if there is a particular genre that needs more development in order to potentially increase their rating and market standpoint.

#### **The Data**
*What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?*

The dataset for this project, via a crawl for retrieval, comes from <http://ign.com/games/reviews>. The data consists of 20 years' worth of IGN game reviews with 18,625 records. 

|Variable|Description|
|----|----|
|score_phrase| Phrase given to describe overall score
|title| Game title 
|url| IGN Game URL
|platform| Game Console
|genre| Video game genre
|score| Overall rating for video game
|editors_choice| Editor Recommended (Y/N) 
|release_year| Year of game release
|release_month| Month of game release
|release_day| Day of game release


```{r game_reviews data, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install.packages("kableExtra")

library(knitr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

game_reviews <- read_csv("ign.csv")

```

```{r game_reviews table, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# preview of the data set

knitr::kable(game_reviews[1:5, ], caption="IGN Data")

```

#### **The Approach**
*In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might
change later)*

My approach can be broken out into the following sections:

1. Data wrangling and cleaning
    + Take into account any missing values or outliers
    + Are there any discontinued consoles? How should they be accounted for?
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
    + Use a combination of inferential statistics and data visualization to identify trends between game consoles and video game ratings
        + Determine potentially significant variables
        + Identify trends and correlations between variables
3. Machine Learning
    + Dig deeper into the correlation between consoles and game ratings using classification techniques and/or regression models
4. Data visualization and report out
    + Compile all relevant information into deliverables (listed below)

#### **Deliverables**
*What are your deliverables?*

My deliverables will consist of a report on my findings, a slide deck, and the corresponding R code used in analyzing the data. In addition, the aforementioned deliverables will be submitted and published on GitHub.
